**Welcome to the page of Amateur Coder, Technology Enthusiastic and Passionate Tech Writer!**
<br>
If you have some project, you need writer, documentation or branding, feel free to contact me. I'm new here in Github but have been writing for publications and for sites like Medium. I enjoy discussing about technologies and I have been going around in different tech events relating to IoT, AI and Blockchain. I do deep researching for these industries and enjoy reading and writing my conclusions and opinions.
<br>
Keeping busy with my companies but I would love to hear from you and discuss about tech.
<br>
ps. *I don't mind if you want to follow my Git*
